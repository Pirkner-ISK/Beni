  <h1> WALTER WHITE </h1>
  <p> This is a Webpage about Walter White </p>
  <p> "Breaking Bad" protagonist Walter White, portrayed by Bryan Cranston, transforms from a desperate high school
    chemistry teacher
    into a morally complex methamphetamine producer. Motivated by his terminal cancer diagnosis, White's journey into
    the criminal
    underworld blurs lines of morality. As he becomes the ruthless "Heisenberg," amassing power and wealth,
    relationships fracture,
    and consequences mount. The series offers a gripping exploration of the high cost of breaking bad, showcasing the
    tragic
    consequences of White's choices. Cranston's compelling portrayal solidifies Walter White as a riveting and morally
    ambiguous
    character in television history.</p>
